*EDIT:* Or not. Did well in exams but I'm still busy...

Although probably very few people have noticed, I have not been very active on this blog in the past few months. This has been deliberate. 

Around this time of last year, I was working on the post for my 2048 clone, when I really should have been preparing for my second year exams. This 'should' became very evident in my exam results.

I made the decision to try to focus more on my studies in the third year, and am pleased to report (to whoever is listening) that I seem to be having a bit more success than in the past. I still have a bit of a way to go, so I will need to maintain e-silence.

However despair not, my countless readers, for I have many plans for things to write about this summer! Until then, I will return to my studies and leave you to yours.
